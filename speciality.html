														 <h1>OPHTHALMOLOGY</h1>
														 <p>
															 Ophthalmology is the study of medical conditions relating to the eye. 
															 Ophthalmologists are doctors who specialize in the medical and surgical treatment of this organ.
															 Some of the most common everyday procedures that an ophthalmologist will perform include diagnosing 
															and monitoring mild eye and vision conditions. 
															They will also spend time prescribing and fitting glasses and contact lenses to correct vision problems.
															Also known as eye doctors, ophthalmologists are the only practitioners trained to provide
														   diagnosis and treatment of eye disorders. They can perform eye exams, dispense medications, prescribe 
														   corrective lenses (eyeglasses or contacts), and perform eye surgery.
														   Ophthalmologists treat a variety of eye disorders from common vision deficiencies to conditions 
														   that can lead to partial or complete blindness. Ophthalmologists will often work with other specialists 
														   in cases where vision loss is secondary to another medical condition, such as diabetes or HIV.

														 <h1>NEUROLOGY</h1>
														 <p>
														    Neurology is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system. 
															Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions
															and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems, including their 
															coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle. Neurological
															practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system.
															 This medical specialty studies the anatomy and physiology of the central nervous system 
															 (brain and spinal cord) and of the peripheral nervous system (nerves); and treats conditions 
															 that affect the nervous system. Neurology intervenes in all types of physiological functions, 
															 such as consciousness, sleeping and waking, communication and language, behavior, movement control,
															 sensory perception, and so on.
															 Clinical Practice focuses on the day-to-day needs of practicing neurologists.
															 Regular features include: approaches to the patient with various neurologic conditions; case-based 
															 articles on ethical issues; "Five New Things" updates on diseases and disorders; office-based issues 
															 and practice management tips; and health policy discussions.

														 <h1>CARDIOLOGY</h1>
														 <p>
														 Cardiology is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well 
														 as some parts of the circulatory system. The field includes medical diagnosis and 
														 treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, 
														 valvular heart disease and electrophysiology.
														 Cardiologists provide the continuing care of patients with cardiovascular disease,
														 performing basic studies of heart function and supervising all aspects of therapy, 
														 including the administration of drugs to modify heart functions.
														 Other advances in cardiology include electrocardiographic monitors, pacemakers and 
														 defibrillators for detecting and treating arrhythmias, radio-frequency ablation 
														 of certain abnormal rhythms, and balloon angioplasty and other nonsurgical
														 treatments of blood vessel obstruction. It is expected that discoveries in genetics
														 and molecular biology will further aid cardiologists in their understanding of cardiovascular disease.
